This repository contains codes and data associated with the article ***"Overcoming chemotherapy resistance in low-grade gliomas: A computational approach"*** (in review).

This work had two goals: i) to construct a mathematical model capable of describing the macroscopic growth of low-grade gliomas (LGG) under the influence of temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy; ii) to use this model to carry out a virtual clinical trial aimed at identifying an improved TMZ protocol that delayed the emergence of acquired TMZ resistance while controlling tumor growth and reducing treatment toxicity.
